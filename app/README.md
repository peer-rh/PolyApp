## Getting Started
1. Init Firebase
```
flutterfire configure
```
2. Create `.env` from `.envtemplate`
3. Create `ios/Flutter/Env.xcconfig` from `ios/Flutter/Env_template.xcconfig`

## Workflow
- I recommend using git worktrees, one for develop and one for main
    - That way you can seperate Dev and Prod Firebase
